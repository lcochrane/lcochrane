### Once upon a time in a GitHub repo far, far, away...

About a decade ago, I was involved in all things open and digital government as a public servant, which included releasing the ACTGov Draft Open Data Policy as a public GitHub repo. While the original repo was taken down at some point after I left, you can [find it archived over on Wayback Machine üï∞Ô∏è ‚èÆÔ∏è](https://web.archive.org/web/20140114012624/http://actgov.github.io/opendatapolicy/))

I'm still super proud that this ended up being the first government policy document released by any Australian jurisdiction as a GitHub repo (shock!) let alone while still in draft form (horror!), encouraging the community to fork it and contribute to our little participatory policy project.
